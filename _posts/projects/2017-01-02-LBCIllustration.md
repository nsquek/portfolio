<p>This series of illustrations was used to illustrate concepts for water, land, and energy requirements for the Living Building Challenge (LBC). The majority of these graphics were used in digital LBC Handbooks and distrubted to project teams, while others were turned into thank you cards for ILFI's Board of Directors.</p>
