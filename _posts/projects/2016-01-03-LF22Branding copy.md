<p>I designed the brand identity for Living Future 22, ILFI's annual conference on sustainable design. I developed the color palette, imagery, and illustrations to support the conference's theme of "Restoration and Justice," which I then turned into digital templates for social media, web, and email applications. I served as the overall project manager for the production of 100+ assets and oversaw another designer's work from start to completion.</p>
<p>The opening week registration numbers eclipsed all prior historical Living Future Conference first-week openings.</p>
