<p>Declare is the International Living Future Institue's material transparency label. I developed this digital marketing campaign targeted at architects and manufacturers. The digital ad campaign ran on Linkedin and saw significant improvement month over month, with a 43% increase in reach and 68% increase in clicks.</p>
