<p>For my final project for Sustainable By Design at the Danish Institute of Study Abroad, I observed a public square in the Vesterbro neighborhood of Copenhagen to answer the question: What elements of a public space encourage people to spend time there, rather than just pass through? I presented my findings and research on Vesterbros Torv in this short film.</p>
