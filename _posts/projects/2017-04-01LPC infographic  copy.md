<p>I designed this infographic for the International Living Future's Living Product Challenge (LPC) Handbook to illustrate the practice of handprinting to manufacturers and project teams. Handprints measure the positive impact that a product has across its lifecycle and were developed in contrast to the idea of a footprint, which is the total negative impacts caused by a product. Although a product can never have a zero footprint, it can still be Net Positive if its handprint is bigger than its footprint. </p>
