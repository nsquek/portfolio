<p>Just, the International Living Future Institute's Social Justice label, asks workplaces to evaluate themselves across a variety of social justice and equity-related metrics. The label champions workplace transparency throughout the process of building a culture that values diversity, equity and inclusion. For the launch of Just 3.0, we wanted to refresh the existing branding visuals and imagery to reflect the mission of Just. I put together this stylescape for the new Just 3.0 handbook.</p>
