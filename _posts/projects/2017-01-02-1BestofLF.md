<p>I was the lead designer on this digital campaign for ILFI's 'Best of Living Future' Online Course Series. I worked closely with the Marketing Director and Education Team to develop the brand identity for this course series, optimize the user experience on the education platform, and create paid and organic social media content. </p>
