<p>This infographic illustrates the practice of 'handprinting' to manufacturers and project teams that are working to achieve the Living Product Challenge (LPC). Handprints measure the positive impact that a product has across its lifecycle and were developed in contrast to the idea of footprints, which are the total negative impacts caused by a product. Although a product can never have a zero footprint, it can still be Net Positive in accordance with LPC if its handprint is bigger than its footprint. </p>
