<p>For our final project for an urban design class, my team proposed a redesign of Bixby Plaza and Walker Lounge at Pomona College. Through site analysis, case study research, design charettes, and stakeholder interviews with students, faculty, and the Facilities Department, we envisioned an activation of the plaza with additional seating opportunities, green spaces, and softened edges. To introduce programming to the plaza, we redesigned Walker Lounge to feature a student-run cafe and more opportunities for collaboration across on-campus organizations.<p>
