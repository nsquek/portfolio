<p>I was the lead designer on this online education campaign for the International Living Future Institute's 'Best of Living Future' Course Series. I worked closely with the Marketing Director and Education Team to develop the look and feel for this course series, optimize the user experience on the education platform, and create paid and organic media.
In the first week of this campaign, the average CTR for Instagram posts was 8.5%, far above platform averages. In its entirety, this campaign increased site traffic by 83%, with traffic from social media up 5000% from the previous period. </p>
