<p>I created this series of illustrations for the International Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge (LBC). Some of these graphics were used in digital LBC Handbooks and distrubted to project teams and some were turned into thank you cards for ILFI's board members. I served as the main point coordinator with the printing company when turning the designs from digital to print.</p>
