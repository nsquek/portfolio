I"x<p>For our final project for our 'Building LA' class, my team proposed a redesign of Bixby Plaza at Pomona College. Through site analysis, research, design charrettes, and stakeholder interviews with students, faculty, and the Facilities Department, we envisioned an activation of the plaza with additional seating opportunities, green spaces, and softened edges.<p>
