I"<p>For this project, I was tasked with creating an infographic that illustrates the practice of 'handprinting' to manufacturers and project teams that are working to achieve ILFI's Living Product Challenge (LPC). I researched the concept, which is unique to ILFI, and presented a rough idea to the LPC Team. From there, we worked together to settle on the final design which I then refined to match our existing brand standards.</p>

<p>Handprints measure the positive impact that a product has across its lifecycle and were developed in contrast to the idea of footprints, which are the total negative impacts caused by a product. Although a product can never have a zero footprint, it can still be Net Positive in accordance with LPC if its handprint is bigger than its footprint. </p>
